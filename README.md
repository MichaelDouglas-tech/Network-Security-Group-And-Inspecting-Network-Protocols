What is a Network Security Group (NSG)?

Think of a Network Security Group like the bouncer at the entrance of a nightclub.

The bouncer has a list of rules: who can come in, who can leave, and who gets turned away.

In computer networks, an NSG works the same way. It’s a set of rules that decides:

Which information is allowed into your system,

Which information is allowed out, and

Which information should be blocked for safety.

So if your computer network is like a house, the NSG is the lock on the doors and windows, only letting trusted people in and out.

🌐 What does “Inspecting Network Protocols” mean?

A network protocol is just a set of rules computers use to talk to each other — kind of like languages. For example:

HTTP/HTTPS = how websites talk to your browser

SMTP = how email is sent

FTP = how files are shared

When we say “inspecting network protocols”, we mean checking the conversation to make sure it looks safe.

👉 Imagine two people talking at your house gate:

If they’re speaking normally (like asking to deliver a package), you let them in.

If they’re whispering suspiciously or carrying something dangerous, you stop them.

That’s what protocol inspection does — it watches the “language” of internet traffic to catch anything harmful, like hackers trying to sneak in.

✅ Why Both Matter Together

NSGs = Decide who can come in or out (the bouncer with rules).

Protocol Inspection = Checks if the conversation itself is safe (the security guard listening for threats).# Network-Security-Group-And-Inspecting-Network-Protocols
